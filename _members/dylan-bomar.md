Dylan is currently pursuing a B.S. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at UC Santa Cruz with plans to complete a Ph.D. in the biomedical field. Reading essays using neuroscience to suggest that free will is an illusion initiated Dylan’s curiosity in the subject and he’s been with it since, even traveling to New York to participate in an internship investigating the relationship between dopamine receptors and drug addiction. Dylan has a special interest in the connection between physiology and behavior and hopes to learn more about that in his graduate studies. Outside of academics, you can find Dylan in the piano practice rooms on campus, manically binge-playing blitz games in chess, or doing kitchen chemistry.
