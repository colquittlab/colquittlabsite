Chinweike was a postdoc in Dr. Lauren Riters’s lab at UW Madison, where he investigated the potential contributions of distinct columns of the midbrain periaqueductal gray to functionally distinct vocal behaviors of male European starlings. He obtained his Ph.D. in Dr. Kazuhiro Wada’s lab at Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan, where he studied the developmental regulation of acetylcholine receptor genes in the neural circuits responsible for vocal learning and production in songbirds. Chinweike has both a BS and MS in Zoology from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. In Brad’s lab, he is curious to better understand the neurobiological mechanisms driving the opening and closure of the critical period of vocal development in songbirds. Outside the lab, Chinweike enjoys football, reading non-scientific books, and seeing the amazing creations of nature.
