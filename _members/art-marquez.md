I grew up in LA county - the city of Whittier, to be exact - before moving to San Diego in 2018 to pursue my undergraduate education at UCSD. While I was originally pursuing electrical engineering, I was soon called by my passion to understand the interworkings of the natural world to switch to biology as an Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution major. As an undergraduate, I worked in Dr. Kim Cooper's lab studying control of limb proportionality in mice. I am very excited to work on my project looking at the comparative neurobiology of various songbird species in search of a molecular answer to differences in song complexity.
