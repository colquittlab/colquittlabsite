I graduated from UCSC with a BS in MCD Biology with highest honors - whatever that means. I’m an east coast transplant who came out here on a road trip and stayed. I’ve always been interested in how the human body works, from small molecular mechanisms to big-picture behavioral/psychological patterns. Originally I was drawn to neuroscience from reading about flow-state research and since then I’ve found many topics in the space that fascinate me. I continue to be interested in neuroscience because it’s still so undiscovered that it’s intrinsically humbling, which I find to be engaging, challenging, and most importantly, fun.
