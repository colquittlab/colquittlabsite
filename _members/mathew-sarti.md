I'm Mathew Sarti, a first generation central Californian, who's planning to graduate at UC Santa Cruz in June 2024 with a major in Neuroscience. I've always felt a sense of awe when it came to the quirks and abilities of human beings, and as I try to understand such complex behaviors I'm reminded of how special that moment is. A lump of matter motivated to process itself and its peers, it's pretty SiFi. So in an effort to satisfy my curiosity and benefit society I plan on dedicating a good portion of my life to researching the mysteries of cognition.
