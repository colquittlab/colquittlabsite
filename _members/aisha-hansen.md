I am pursuing a B.S. in MCD Biology and Cognitive Science at UC Santa Cruz and aim for a Ph.D. in Cognitive Neuroscience. I worked in the High Level Perception Lab in the Cognitive Science department designing a misophonia study and running multiple other studies such as on earworms, apparent motion illusions, and eye movement biases. The more I’ve learned about perception and language comprehension the more I’ve wanted to know the biological mechanisms giving rise to each process. I am amazed by our ability to perceive the world around us and our comprehension of complex language and I am excited to learn about the molecular factors behind these abilities. Outside of the lab, I love to crochet, sculpt, and read.
