I like to say I’m Sacramento raised but Seattle grown. I’m an example of what happens when a village raises a child, and I'm lucky enough to have experienced many things and ways of life. I’ve always been fascinated by biology and how everything is connected. I’m drawn to neuroscience specifically because we are the product of our environment but our perception of our environment is what creates our own unique experiences. I graduated from UCSC as a MCDB major studying mammalian developmental biology and am now excited to explore avian developmental neuroscience as a PhD student.
