Darian is currently working towards a B.S. in Neuroscience at UCSC and plans on pursuing a Ph.D. in MCD biology. Fascinated by the complexity of biological systems sculpted through evolution, Darian is intent on investigating the factors behind such processes. When not in the lab or class, Darian is hiking through the Santa Cruz mountains or floating amongst the kelp chasing surf.
