Amanda is an undergraduate at UC Santa Cruz who is currently pursuing the Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology BS. She joined the Colquitt Lab in the spring of 2024, and was drawn to it because of the broad implications of the songbird research from a developmental scale all the way to the evolutionary scale. Aside from being in the lab and doing schoolwork, her time is typically spent reading novels, playing video games, and exploring nature or new cities. She hopes to take her research to the *nest* leve!
