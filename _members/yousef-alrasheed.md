I am a master’s student who grew up in Kuwait before coming to UCSC, where I initially pursued a major in marine biology. After discovering a much stronger attraction to the realm of neuroscience, I joined Dave Feldheim’s lab, where I contributed to characterizing the density and topography of synaptic inputs from the auditory cortex to the superior colliculus in mice. In the Colquitt lab, I aim to research the molecular basis of birdsong motor output plasticity throughout development, and the extent to which this trait can be bidirectionally manipulated.
