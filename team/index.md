Our lab encompasses approaches and ideas from systems neuroscience, developmental biology, evolution, and genomics, and we're excited to build a diverse and collaborative team of researchers. We're actively recruiting at several levels and look forward to welcoming new members. Please contact Brad at colquitt@ucsc.edu for more information.

We are located on the stunning UC Santa Cruz campus, embedded in a redwood forest on the northern end of the Monterey Bay, in the vibrant city of Santa Cruz.

### Postdoctoral Researcher

We are looking for postdocs interested in bringing fresh ideas and skill sets to questions in developmental and evolutionary neurobiology. We are looking for candidates with a strong background in molecular biology (including the generation and/or analysis of diverse sequencing approaches, gene editing), developmental biology (including embryo manipulation), and/or design and analysis of behavioral experiments.

Please email Brad a CV and a cover letter describing your research background, current interests, and how you think you could contribute to ongoing work or new directions in the lab.

### Graduate students

The lab is excited to welcome rotation students through the [Graduate Training Program in Biomedical Sciences and Engineering](https://pbse.ucsc.edu/) at UCSC. Please get in touch for more information.

### Undergraduate students

Experiencing the scientific process directly by working in an academic research lab is an important part of undergraduate education at UCSC, and we're excited to have undergrads join the lab.
